Can ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-S3 Touch pass the EMS conduction interference test?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The EMS conduction interference test is a whole machine test, which is jointly affected by internal and external power supplies, circuits, and external environments. Since the ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-S3 Touch has poor anti-interference ability, if users have this test requirement, it is recommended to externally connect a dedicated Touch IC or use ESP32-P4.

--------------

Can ESP32-P4 Touch pass the EMS conduction interference test?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Yes, ESP32-P4 Touch can pass the EMS 3V conduction interference test (This requires a dedicated software driver. Please contact Espressif if needed).

--------------

When using ESP32 to develop Touch Sensor applications, where can I find references?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Please refer to `Software and Hardware Designs <https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/tree/release/v1.1/examples/touch_pad_evb>`_.

--------------

When there is water on ESP32-S2 Touch Sensor, does it block or recognize the Touch event with its waterproof function?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  When there is a small amount of water droplets, the waterproof function of the ESP32-S2 Touch Sensor can work normally. In the event of a large area of standing water (i.e. the Touch contact area is completely covered), the Touch will temporarily lock and will not resume operation until the water is cleared.

--------------

While the waterproof feature of ESP32-S2 Touch Sensor shielding the Touchpad with water flow, does other pads with no water still usable?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Yes, the specific shielding channel can be selected via software.

--------------

Are there any recommendations for materials that can be used to test Touch Sensor, can trigger Touch Sensor stably and is close to the parameters of human touches?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For experiments with high consistency requirements, it is doable to replace human hands with cell phone pencils.

--------------

Can the pins of Touch Sensor be remapped?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  No, because Touch Sensor is realized via software programming.

--------------

Do I need to reset a check threshold for Touch Sensor after covering it with a acrylic plate?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Yes.

--------------

Is it possible for Touch Sensor to detect whether there is a acrylic plate on the top, so that it can switch to the pre-defined threshold value automatically when there is a acrylic plate added or removed?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For now, it cannot adapt to the impacts brought by physical changes.

---------------

What reference drivers are available for ESP32 touch screens?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  For touch screen drivers, refer to:

  - esp-iot-solution touch driver: `lcd_touch <https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/tree/master/components/display/lcd_touch>`__.
  - esp-bsp touch driver: `lcd_touch <https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp/tree/master/components/lcd_touch>`__.

---------------

How long does it take from the moment of touch to the time when the chip detects the touch and issues a command signal?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If n channels are used, and each channel takes about 2 ms to measure, one round of polling would take 2n ms.

---------------

When the ESP32-S3 touch pin is grounded and touched with human body multiple times, the four pin values previously defined changed to a fixed constant, resulting in invalid pin state. What is the reason for this?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The touch pin must not be grounded. This is what happens when it is grounded.
